# time_capsule
A platform where users can create digital time capsules, adding messages, photos, videos, and other digital mementos, to be locked and opened at a later specified date.



Planning & Research

•	Tasks:•	Identify target audience and their requirements.•	Research similar platforms or services to identify potential features.•	Draft initial sketches or wireframes of the user interface.•	Tools Needed:•	Wireframing tools (e.g., Balsamiq, Figma, or Adobe XD).•	Note-taking or documentation tools (e.g., Google Docs, Notion).•	Estimated Time: 1 week.

Design UI/UX

•	Tasks:•	Design a clean and intuitive user interface.•	Prototype the user journey (from registration to creating and locking a capsule).•	Tools Needed:•	UI/UX design tools (e.g., Adobe XD, Figma).•	Estimated Time: 2-3 weeks.

Set Up Development Environment

•	Tasks:•	Choose a tech stack.•	Set up version control.•	Establish a development, staging, and production environment.•	Tools Needed:•	Git (for version control).•	GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket (for repository hosting).•	Text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ).•	Web servers, cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku).•	Estimated Time: 1 week.

Backend Development

•	Tasks:•	Set up database schema and models.•	Develop user registration and authentication.•	Implement capsule creation, editing, and time-lock functionality.•	Ensure security measures, especially for stored data.•	Tools Needed:•	Backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Django, Flask).•	Database management systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).•	Authentication middleware (e.g., Passport.js, JWT).•	Estimated Time: 4-6 weeks.

Frontend Development

•	Tasks:•	Build responsive web pages based on UI/UX designs.•	Integrate with backend services using API calls.•	Test user flows and interactivity.•	Tools Needed:•	Frontend libraries/frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular).•	Package managers (e.g., npm, yarn).•	API testing tools (e.g., Postman).•	Estimated Time: 4-6 weeks.

Testing & QA

•	Tasks:•	Conduct unit tests.•	Run integration and system tests.•	Perform user acceptance testing.•	Tools Needed:•	Testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Jasmine).•	Bug tracking tools (e.g., Jira, Bugzilla).•	Estimated Time: 2-3 weeks.

Deployment & Monitoring

•	Tasks:•	Deploy the website to a production environment.•	Monitor for issues and gather user feedback.•	Tools Needed:•	Deployment tools (e.g., Jenkins, Docker).•	Monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus).•	Web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache).•	Estimated Time: 2 weeks.

Maintenance & Updates

•	Tasks:•	Regularly update libraries and dependencies.•	Implement new features based on user feedback.•	Continuously monitor for and fix any bugs.•	Tools Needed:•	All tools from previous steps as required.•	Estimated Time: Ongoing.

Division of Labor for a Team of 3:

1.	Developer 1 (Frontend Specialist): Focus on UI/UX design and frontend development.
2.	Developer 2 (Backend Specialist): Handle backend development, databases, and authentication.
3.	Developer 3 (DevOps/Full-stack Developer): Oversee setting up the development environment, deployment, monitoring, and assist with frontend or backend as needed.

Total Estimated Time for a Team of 3:

Approximately 4 to 5 months for the initial launch, with ongoing maintenance and updates. Note that the timeline can vary based on the complexity of the features, team’s familiarity with the tools, and unforeseen challenges.
